# Enterprise System Administration CAPSTONE
The purpose of this project was to use the culmination of of my studies and apply them in a project which will serve the purpose of gaining hands on knowledege to what I've learned
## Project Summary
This project was done in groups of three and a summary of the tasks were: 
  * *Configure a network which was based on a preconfigured network structure*
  * *Remove any malicous data on the machines that were deployed to the team*
  * *Configure machines to communicate with each other and establish internet connections*
  * *Establish a DNS server and use Active Directory*
  * Create three goods and three services
  * *Host a website which would sell these goods and services to customers*
  * *Install and configure a database to work with the webserver*
  * Create backups of the database server
  * Deploy an email server which will be used to communicate with the customers
  * Have network monitoring software which will allow the team to identify threats / unusual traffic
  * Generate logs 
  * *Run vulnerability scans to determine the networks security*


***The italized items were the tasks I was responsible for**


  **Expectations:**
  * Be resilient against hacking attempts (Red team) 
  * Handle traffic generated by customers (Orange team) 
  * Respond to customer inquiries
  * Complete orders 
## Networking
The image below was the network that was given to us. The IP addresses on the diagram weren't configured on the machines, they were reccomended IP addresses.

The difficult part of networking was figuing out which interface was facing which way, the diagram above was deceptive/inaccurate which made it quite difficult to configure the network.

My solution: 
 1. Configure the machines ip addresses and DNS servers (DNS explained in a later section)

 3. Configure router/firewall one device at a time
    - I would configure one interface at a time pinging to a device and vice versa to ensure proper configuration
 4. On the routers and firewall I would set up static routes to ensure proper routing of traffic through the different subnets
 5. Configure the firewall to allow all traffic for the development purposes
    - Firewall rules were created after development was complete and the network hardening phase started

therefore it took a lot of trial and error to properly configure the network. My attempt to resolve this issu
